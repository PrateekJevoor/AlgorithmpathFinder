# AlgorithmpathFinder

This mini game based on Python and pygame module uses the principle of Djikstra's path finding Algorithm. The basic principle of which is to find the shortest path between two points.
the way this is played is 
move the code to a text editor 
and execute the code 
a window appears where using the mouse right click to place start and end point 
do not remove the finger from the mouse and create walls inbetween if needed.
while pressing the right click on mouse press enter to begin the animation
The animation when complete will give the shortest path between the two points.

Note: If one of the point is completely blocked by walls from all sides then the agorithm fails to find the shortest path. :(
